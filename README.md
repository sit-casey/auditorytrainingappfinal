Code/Auditory Training App is the directory that contains all of the code required to make app functional. If/When other directories are added, they will be used for documentation.

The Auditory Training App/src directory is where all the source code for the application lies. The main entrypoint of the application is through index.js, which is where the application is created, and immediately calls App.js where all other components that change the UI must be referenced.

Project Structure provides a visual imagery of how classes call each other and how the project is structured.
